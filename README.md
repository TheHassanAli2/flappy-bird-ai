# flappy-bird-ai
Create an ai for the popular game flappy bird to learn neural networks and basic reinforcement learning with games.

Try not to use videos of this exact project because then you're not trying to apply something you've learned, you're just copying.

Create AI:
Import neat library
Change config.txt
Setup the neat algorithm
Modify Game to work with the algorithm
